\section{Statement of Purpose}
In ECE 205 lecture, we deal with ideal voltage and current sources, but in real life, there are no such things.
In this lab, we will use a battery, which is a device which converts chemical energy into electrical energy.
Even though we typically think of batteries as ideal voltage sources, we will characterize ways in which the battery differs from the ideal voltage source.
